The SHARPs are intended to help you develop the following skills:

- Active and critical close reading of texts
- Exegesis: developing an interpretation of the text
- Written communication of your interpretation of the text

## Criteria

Papers receiving high grades will excel according to each of the following criteria:

### Exegesis—Analysis—Argument

Your paper should demonstrate exegetical acumen by presenting a compelling argument that is soundly based on a close reading of the details of the text.

The keys here are:

- your identification of the most relevant and important passages of the text, and
- your ability to convince the reader that *your* interpretation of those passages is a compelling one.

### Use and citation of sources

Your paper should include a judicious amount of quotation, paraphrasing, and appropriate citation of the text in question. There is an art to finding the most compelling balance of quotation and paraphrasing, which these papers will help you practice. In *all* cases, citation is required. The conventional abbreviations used in citing ancient texts and modern scholarly works appear on the relevant prompt.

### Organization

Though these short papers are NOT conventional "five-paragraph" essays, your paper should still be well organized and proceed logically from a brief statement of your argument to your exegetical treatment of the key passages you have identified. Extended introductions and conclusions are not required.

### Quality of Writing

Your argument should be expressed in clear, concise, and readable English. There should be no errors of grammar or spelling. Precision and elegance of expression will be rewarded.

## Specifications

- Papers must be 750 words in length (approx. 2–3 pages).
- Papers must be in 12-point font, with double spacing of lines.
- Papers should have a brief title, but there is no need for a title page.
- A bibliography is also not necessary on these short response papers.

## Submission

- The paper is due before the class with which it is associated.
