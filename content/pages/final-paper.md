The final paper will be an analytical essay of 1,500 words ( ≈ 5–6 pages). In this paper, you will be expected to demonstrate the skills developed in your earlier writing assignments (i.e. close analysis of ancient written and archaeological sources and critical understanding of modern scholarly works) as well as an ability to sustain a clear, well-organized, and compelling thesis-driven argument.
