## Reading Quizzes

You are required to complete all reading assignments in time for the meeting with which they are associated, as indicated on the schedule. You are also required to have with you in class a copy of any reading that has been assigned. In order to give you credit for close and critical reading in preparation for each class, 20% of your final grade will be based on open-book reading quizzes to be taken before most class meetings.

## Short Analytical Response Papers (SHARPs)

Two short (750 words ≈ 2–3 pages each) papers will require students to engage in close reading and critical analysis of key ancient written and archaeological sources and modern scholarly works. Students must complete option A or B and option C or D.

These papers will count for 20% of your final grade. For further detail, see {{% resource_link "4c3f6de0-a0dd-4e2e-95aa-67f00906cedf" "Short Analytical Response Papers (SHARPs)" %}}.

## Museum Artifact Video Project

A five-minute (≈ 750-word script) video presentation of an ancient Roman artifact relevant to Augustus or Nero and selected from the online collection of a reputable museum.

This project will count for 20% of your final grade. For further detail, see {{% resource_link "a6b6e797-c520-479d-9931-517b9a25d6cd" "Museum Artifact Video Project" %}}.

## Final Paper

The final paper will be an analytical essay of 1,500 words (≈ 5–6 pages). In this paper, you will be expected to demonstrate the skills developed in your earlier writing assignments (i.e. close analysis of ancient written and archaeological sources and critical understanding of modern scholarly works) as well as an ability to sustain a clear, well-organized, and compelling thesis-driven argument.
