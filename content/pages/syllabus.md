## Course Description

Through close examination of the emperor Augustus and his Julio-Claudian successors, this subject investigates how Roman emperors used art, architecture, coinage, and other media to create and project an image of themselves, how the surviving literary sources from the Roman period reinforced or subverted that image, and how both phenomena have contributed to post-classical perceptions of Roman emperors. It also considers works of Suetonius and Tacitus, as well as modern representations of the emperors such as those found in the films *I, Claudius*, *Quo Vadis*, and HBO's *Rome* series.

## Recommended Online Resources

[The Oxford Classical Dictionary](http://classics.oxfordre.com/), a scholarly and authoritative encyclopedia of all things ancient Greek and Roman.

[The Loeb Classical Library Online](https://www.loebclassics.com/). The LCL has long been the go-to collection for reading English translations of ancient texts alongside the original Greek or Latin. Some LCL translations are now quite old and correspondingly stilted; but the collection is comprehensive and reliable.

[LacusCurtius](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/home.html). Many of the same texts appear on the LCL site, but here in a format that some will find more user-friendly. 

[JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org/). The Scholarly Journal Archive, including relevant classical studies and archaeology journals.
