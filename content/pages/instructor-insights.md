## Student Information

12 students

### Student Background

Two seniors; five juniors; four sophomores and one first-year student. Four of the students had previously taken at least one other ancient history class with Prof. Broadhead at MIT. About half were already or have since become History or Ancient and Medieval Studies Concentrators or Minors. Most of the others were studying Roman history for the first time. The composition of the class for this subject has been fairly consistent over the years.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### Lectures

- Met twice per week for 1.5 hours per session; 26 sessions total; mandatory attendance.

### Out of Class

- Outside of class, students studied for quizzes, wrote two short analytical response papers and a longer final paper, and completed a video project focusing on a historic artifact.
